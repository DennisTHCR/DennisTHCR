### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a fighter game, written in x86-64 assembly using OpenGL for graphics.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning OpenGL and x86-64 assembly to further understand the lower level workings of a computer and aid in debugging compiled applications.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people on a game similar to VALORANT.
ðŸ“« How to reach me: I am mostly on discord. dennis#3203
âš¡ Fun fact: I make YouTube videos on my channel called "DennisTHCR".
